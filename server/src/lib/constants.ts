The image must show: 1) The palm surface (not the back of hand), 2) Clear palm lines (heart line, head line, life line, etc.), 3) The entire palm area visible. The image may contain other elements in the background or frame, but a clear palm must be prominently visible. Answer with only 'yes' or 'no' and provide a brief explanation.`,
